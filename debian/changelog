mirrorbits (0.5.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
  * Adjust dependencies for use with GeoIP2
    - Drop libgeoip-dev build dependency since the vendored maxminddb-golang
      module is used for reading the databases.
    - Switch from geoip-update-contrib to the geoipupdate package since the
      latter fetches the GeoLite2 databses for use with GeoIP2.
    - Run geoipupdate in the postinst if the GeoLite2 city database doesn't
      exist since mirrorbits requires it.
  * Add build dependencies for generating the new gRPC protobufs.
